# 🚀 Socket.IO Learning Repository

This repository is created to learn, practice, and understand real-time communication using Socket.IO with Node.js.  
It contains examples, experiments, and mini features related to WebSockets and real-time event handling.

## 📌 What is Socket.IO?

Socket.IO is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients (browser) and servers.

Common use cases include:
- Real-time chat applications
- Live notifications
- Online multiplayer games
- Collaborative applications

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Socket.IO
- JavaScript
- HTML / CSS (for frontend testing)

## 🌐 How It Works

- The server establishes a Socket.IO connection
- Clients connect using sockets
- Events are emitted and listened to in real time
- Data is exchanged instantly without page reloads

---

## ✨ Learning Goals

- Socket connection and disconnection
- Emitting and listening to events
- Multiple client communication
- Real-time broadcasting
- Basic socket debugging
